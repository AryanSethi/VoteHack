<h3>Background</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Last year, INDIA had the highest voter turnout in history of Indian National elections ,which is a direct indication that more people are getting aware of the importance of           elections year by year, but even after being the highest turnout, it was a mere 67%. A number of factors are responsible for less people voting in India ranging from 
      inaccessibility to their native geolocation to a variety of corruptive malpractices. Now to solve all these problems, we need large changes in the entire electoral system.

<h3>Proposal</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      We started out with an idea of making a mobile application which would be  easily accessible and would contain the best security features any mobile application can have.         There comes <b>Suffragium</b>, the modern way to vote. <b>Suffragium</b> is a flutter based cross platform mobile application build with security, scalability and   
      accessibility in mind. It comes with 5 layers of security which according to our calculations has a failiure probability of 0.00097 (that too for very unrealistic cases) 
    </p><br/>
    <b><i>The application is still under development but the APK of the first mile stone can be found <a href="">here<a/>)</i></b>

<h3>Future Milestones</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      We plan on building an entire self reliant voting system from scratch, starting with this mobile application. For now, the Voter ID cards provided by the 
      government of India are used to authenticate voters which is simply not enough. New Identification methods will be implemented which will autherize everything from finger-
      prints to facial landmarks and even more.
